% This is the LaTeX template file for lecture notes for EE 382C/EE 361C.
%
% To familiarize yourself with this template, the body contains
% some examples of its use.  Look them over.  Then you can
% run LaTeX on this file.  After you have LaTeXed this file then
% you can look over the result either by printing it out with
% dvips or using xdvi.
%
% This template is based on the template for Prof. Sinclair's CS 270.
